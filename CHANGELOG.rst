Change Log
==========

v3.14.0 (22SEP21)
-----------------
* :bug: Fixed a bug that was causing the part reference properties to not be copied correctly. (PROJ-241)
* :+1: Improved speed of the code by a different way of validation of the property options. We validated the property options using jsonschema validation on every instantiation of the property and that is overkill. Now we do it once we are updating the property itself. (#1029)
* :+1: Added py.typed to the bdist package to indicate that pykechain supports typing. According to PEP-561.

v3.13.1 (24AUG21)
-----------------
* :+1: Add additionally a `UsePropertyNameRepresentation` including additional testing for empty `config` objects inside the `Representation`. (KE-1239)

v3.13.0 (23AUG1)
----------------
* :star: We added filter `tags__contains` to `Context` (KE-1054)
* :+1: Added the `usePropertyName` property representation to sync with the possibilities in the backend. (KE-1239)
* :+1: dependent versions for development: requests (2.26.0), nbsphinx (0.8.7), coveralls (3.2.0), tox (3.24.3), sphinx (4.1.2), pre-commit (2.14.0), twine (3.4.2)

v3.12.0 (1JUL21)
----------------
* :star: We added the `Context` object to pykechain that has full API access to the `Context` API in KE-chain v2021.6 and newer. You can add time period contexts, static location contexts and textlabel contexta and put them under a `context_group` if desired. This `Context` feature is now implemented limitly for `Activities` but in the coming period will be extended to support extensive usecases for the Forms NG featureset that is coming this fall. (KE-925)
* :bug: Fixed a test cassette that was failing on a date check. Made it use a fixed date rather than doing it on today.
* :bug: Fixed automatic compilation of the pykechain documentation on https://readthedocs.org/projects/pykechain/.
* :+1: From now on python 3.5 is deprecated. The lowest version we support is Python 3.6. We can now start to insert f-strings and variable type annotations in our pykechain codebase.
* :+1: refactoring all models that were shadowed with a `<classname>2` to enable fast and smooth deprecation in July 2021.
* :+1: We converted all type annotations in comments to proper type and variable annotations.
* :+1: When connecting to a server with a SSL certificate error which cannot be checked, we provide a message fast and dont retry. (KE-1052, #997)

# Backward Incompatible Changes

* We dropped support for Python versions 3.5 and lower. Python 3.5 reached end of life in Sep 2020 and no more new releases will be made. Consider upgrading to a newer version of Python. See: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478/

v3.11.1 (15JUN21)
-----------------
* :bug: Fixed an issue related to setting prefilters on a `ScopeReferenceProperty`.
* :bug: Fixed a bug related to a `UserReferenceProperty` not being copied over if there was a `User` already filled in. Improved the tests to cover all property types.
* :star: Added `CONTAINS_SET` filter type enum for `contains`.

v3.11.0 (27MAY21)
-----------------
* :star: It is now possible to create, retrieve, edit and delete `ExpiringDownloads` using the `Client` and `Class` methods.
* :star: Added the GeoCoordinate representation for Geojson properties. We can now represent a geocoordinate as approximate address, Rijksdriehoekstelsel RD Amersfoort, as decimal degrees and degrees minutes seconds.
* :bug: Formatting of prefilters using lists in the `ScopeFilter` class is now based on comma's.
* :+1: Correctly formatted datetime strings are now accepted as valid datetime values.
* :+1: dependent versions for development: pytest (6.2.4), nbsphinx (0.8.5), coveralls (3.1.0), tox (3.23.1), flake8 (3.9.2), sphinx (4.0.2), pytest-cov (2.12.0), pre-commit (2.13.0), pydocstyle (6.1.1)

v3.10.1 (01APR21)
-----------------

* :bug: Copying multiple attachments using the `part.copy()` method caused the temporary directory to be removed.

v3.10.0 (29MAR21)
-----------------

* :star: It is now possible to create a `TasksWidget` with the new `add_tasks_widget` method to the `WidgetsManager` class. The enums `TasksAssignmentFiltersTypes` and `TasksWidgetColumns` support the inputs to this method.
* :star: It is now possible to create a `ScopemembersWidget` with the new `add_scopemembers_widget` method to the `WidgetsManager` class.
* :bug: For grid widgets, corrected name of field `incompleteRowsVisible` to `incompleteRowsButtonVisible`.
* :bug: Widgets created with the `create_widgets` method of the `WidgetsManager` class now append the internal `_widgets` attribute.
* :bug: Added allowed use of `Autofill` representation object on `UserReferenceProperty` classes.
* :bug: Creating of new activities was performed using `data` instead of `json`. Now, `None` values are cleared and the request allows `kwargs`.
* :+1: The order of `Part` instances returned from the `Client._create_parts_bulk()` method is now guaranteed to match the request.
* :+1: Datetime properties can now be set using (valid) string values.
* :+1: Added `now_in_my_timezone` method to the `User` class, to retrieve the current time based on the timezone of that user.
* :+1: The input `collapse_filter` in the `add_filteredgrid_widget` method now accepts the input `None` to fully hide the filter panel.
* :+1: Expanded `ScopeFilter` options to the support the following `Scope` attributes: tag, status, name, team, due date, start date and progress.
* :+1: Added file path as return value of the `download_as_pdf` method of the `Activity` class.
* :+1: Added `status` keyword to the `ScopeFilter` class. All filters are now parsed and written to option dicts internally, encapsulating the property-specific format of the filters.
* :+1: dependent versions for development: pytest (6.2.2), pytz (2021.1), mypy (0.812), nbsphinx (0.8.2), coveralls (3.0.1), tox (3.23.0), flake8 (3.9.0), twine (3.4.1), sphinx (3.5.3), pytest-cov (2.11.1), pre-commit (2.11.1), pydocstyle (6.0.0)


Improved the `copy` and `move` methods of the `Part` class.

* :bug: Part reference properties with a value set to the copied Part's children will no longer refer to the original child Parts. That is, such "internal" references are updated with the new child Parts.
* :+1: `move` now makes use of the `copy` method directly, simplifying the `move` method and reducing duplicate code.
* :+1: More efficient use of `populate_descendants` and other bulk operations when cloning the data model.
* :+1: Refreshing a `part` now also refreshes its `properties` in-place, instead of creating new Python objects.
* :+1: Added `DeprecationWarnings` to the original, public functions, for deprecation in July 2021.

Backwards incompatible changes:
-------------------------------
* In case a `Part` model is copied to a `target_parent` model with zero (or more than one) instances, using `include_instances` now results in an `IllegalArgumentError`. Previously, zero parents would not produce any instance and multiple parents would create duplicate instances.


v3.9.5 (23DEC20)
----------------

* :bug: Any `kwargs` in the `count_children()` methods of the `Activity` and `Part` classes were not being forwarded to the actual function. Now filters such as `name__contains` are properly supported.

v3.9.4 (23DEC20)
----------------

* :star: Implemented `download_as_excel` method to the `Widget` class, to export any grid widget as an Excel file.

* :bug: Removed multiple `return` statements from `_validate_edit_arguments` helper function in the `Activity` class, enabling usage of kwargs.
* :bug: Fixed a bug regarding the code expected to return from the back-end when calling the `share_pdf` and `share_link` functions.

* :+1: Added keyword arguments (kwargs) to the `execute()` method of the `Service` class, in order to insert contextual information into the `ServiceExecution`.
* :+1: Added `count_children` method to the `Activity` and `Part` classes for a light-weight count of the number of child objects.
* :+1: Added `include_qr_code` keyword to the `download_as_pdf` and `share_pdf` methods of the `Activity` class, to include a QR-code to the original KE-chain activity.
* :+1: Added `automatic` paper-size option for `PaperSize` enumeration class.
* :+1: dependent versions for development: sphinx (3.4.0), requests (2.25.1), pytest (6.2.1), pre-commit (2.9.3)

v3.9.3 (8DEC20)
---------------

* :bug: Fixed a wrong `MetaWidget` enum that was causing an issue when creating a `FilteredGrid` widget.
* :+1: Added `category` keywords to `edit()` method of `Scope` class and enabled providing of keyword argument to all edit methods.


v3.9.2 (3DEC20)
---------------

* :+1: Pykechain now supports Python version 3.7 and 3.8 on its `Scripts` and `Notebook` classes. Removed the support of Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6.

v3.9.1 (27NOV20)
----------------

* :bug: In the `Part.property()` method, the property is retrieved by matching a `name` prior to matching a `ref`, to prevent conflicts when these might identical between different properties.
* :bug: The `text` and `is_active` inputs for editing of a `Banner` were not properly managed, leading to API errors or unchanged values.
* :bug: Batched property values of `BaseReference` and inherited classes are now stored as lists of dicts instead of list of UUIDs, to simulate values retrieved directly from KE-chain.
* :bug: Resolved small issue where `empty` values were being combined with normal objects in the `edit_cascade_down()` method of the `Activity` class.

* :+1: Refactored a lot of the strings used in the `Widget` meta into enums, to help with consistency.
* :+1: Retrieving the `value` of any reference property is now performed in batches to limit request size, using the existing `get_in_chunks` utility function.
* :+1: Editing the `title` and `meta` of a `Widget` can now be performed simultaneously and `title` can be cleared by providing `None`.
* :+1: Added input validation and additional tests for `update_widgets()` method of `Client` class.
* :+1: Set identical type hinting for `title` keywords in all methods of the `WidgetsManager` and `Widget` classes.
* :+1: In the `set_prefilters()` and `set_excluded_propmodels()` methods of the `MultiReferenceProperty` class, users can now provide the referenced model to validate against, or bypass validation altogether, using the `validate` input argument.
* :+1: The `child()` method of the `Activity` class now tries to find a cached child prior to requesting the child from KE-chain, similar to the `Part` class.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* As planned and marked with a PendingDeprecationWarning we deprecate the customizations of Activities. This can only be done with old KE-chain versions which are no longer available in production.
* Deleted enumeration class `ComponentXType`

v3.9.0 (05NOV20)
----------------

* :star: Added the option to manage supervisor members on a scope for KE-chain 3 backends that support the supervisor member users. That is possible for releases of KE-chain 3 starting from June 2020. (version 3.7). #772
* :star: Added the possibility to create a `ServiceCardWidget` through the `add_service_card_widget()` function.
* :star: Added the possibility to create a `DashboardWidget` through the `add_dashboard_widget()` function.

* :bug: Updating or setting of widget associations with only readable and/or writable properties is now supported.
* :bug: Missing upper-case letter in `SideBarManager` caused a loss of the `override_sidebar` property.
* :bug: `SidebarButton` class did not preserve all data from the scope options, losing display names in other languages. Editing of this values is now possible as well.
* :bug: Added a check whether the value of a single or multi select list `Property` is in the options when copying or moving a `Part`.

* :+1: Created `PropertyValueFilter` class to manage (pre)filters of `MultiReferenceProperty` and `FilteredGridWidget` objects.
* :+1: Created `ScopeFilter` class to manage (pre)filters of `ScopeReferencesProperty`.

* :+1: Added `refresh()` method on `SideBarManager` to reload the side-bar from KE-chain.
* :+1: Added `get_prefilters()` and `set_prefilters()` method to all reference property classes by default, albeit raising a `NotImplementedError`. Implementations exist for `ScopeReferencesProperty` and `MultiReferenceProperty`.
* :+1: Added `get_excluded_propmodel_ids()` method to the `MultiReferenceProperty` class.
* :+1: Added `alignment` keyword arguments for the creation of `ServiceCardWidget` and `ServiceWidget` classes.
* :+1: Added `ref` keyword to `create_activity()` method of `Client`

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

The following changes are not compatible with previous functionality:

* Changed the way edit functions work for `Part`, `Properties`, `Activity`, `Scope`, `Notification`, `Service`, `Team` and `Banner` classes. Passing inputs with value None in those functions will clear those attributes if possible. Not mentioning them will not overwrite their values.
* The `overwrite` keyword argument in the `set_prefilters()` method of the `MultiReferenceProperty` now only overwrites prefilters if explicitly provided with new ones. Removing all prefilters is now supported with the keyword argument `clear`, also a boolean.
* Specifying prefilters via separate lists of properties, values and filter types is planned to be deprecated in January 2021 in favor of using `Filter` objects as input.

v3.8.2 (18SEP20)
----------------

* :bug: The `descendants` of a `Part` with classification `CATALOG` returns both the Catalog and Product descendants. This broke the guaranteed parent-child relationship when populating the descendants in the `populate_descendants()` method of the `Part` class.
* :bug: KeyError in `add_with_properties()` method of the `Part` class.
* :+1: dependent versions for development: pytest (6.0.2)

v3.8.1 (08SEP20)
----------------

* :bug: Added `title_visible` property to `Widget` class for the widget's title shown in KE-chain, deprecating the `default_title` mechanism when creating widgets. The default title of a widget is dependent on front-end and is not stored in the widget.
* :bug: Set and Update of widget associations now handles optional `part_instance_id` and/or `parent_part_instance_id` inputs.
* :bug: `WidgetsManager` and `PartSet` no longer implement `Iterable` as an "iterator", making it possible to loop over the Widgets/Parts multiple times.
* :bug: `add_signature_widget()` method of the `WidgetManager` class now creates an editable signature widget by default. The new input argument `editable` can be set to False to create a viewable widget.

* :+1: Added `update_activities` method to `Client` to update activities in bulk.
* :+1: `WidgetsManager` is now stored in its `Activity` object for lazy retrieval, while the `WidgetsManager` now explicitly stores a reference to its `Activity`.
* :+1: Available `Part` options of a pre-filtered multi-reference properties are now filtered when using the `choices()` method on the `MultiReferenceProperty`.
* :+1: Added `model_id` attribute to `Part` class.
* :+1: Added `count_instances()` method to the `Part` class, to retrieve the number of Part instances of a Part model.
* :+1: Added `get_landing_page_url()` method to the `Scope` class, to retrieve the (relative) URL of landing page for that scope. Append it to the client's API root for a full URL.
* :+1: Added `LanguageCodes` enum class to enumerate the available Language options for user profiles.
* :+1: Added `value_ids()` method to `_ReferenceProperty` class, returning a list of UUIDs instead of Pykechain objects.
* :+1: Added lazy retrieval in `parent()` method of `TreeObject`, `Part` and `Activity` classes. Retrieving children or populating descendants also sets all known parent objects.
* :+1: Inverted the inheritance hierarchy of Class2 classes, allowing for type-checking via `isinstance()`. However, creating objects from these classes is no longer supported.
* :+1: Added `set_associations` and `remove_associations` method to the `Widget` class (#827)
* :+1: Renamed activity clone API endpoint is now supported. We now support the cloning and renaming of Parts as well as cloning the activities. (#805)
* :+1: Added support of user references and scope references properties in pykechain by implementing the `UserReferencesProperty` and `ScopeReferencesProperty` classes. (#832)
* :+1: Included pending deprecation of version-2 classes such as `Part2`, `Property2`. It is advised to use the original `Part` and `Property` classes instead. (#713)
* :+1: dependent versions for development: sphinx (3.2.1), pytest-cov (2.10.1), tox (3.20.0), pydocstyle (5.1.1), pre-commit (2.7.1), coveralls (2.1.2)

v3.8.0 (11AUG20)
----------------

* :star: Added the bulk_create_parts API endpoint, which allows the adding of multiple `Part` instances with `Properties` in one call. #797
* :star: Added the bulk_delete_parts API endpoint, which allows the deletion of multiple `Part` objects in one call. #812
* :+1: Implemented robust method to update Scope side-bar buttons with minimum number of requests using a context manager (e.g. `with scope.sidebar as manager` mechanism) (#654)
* :+1: Included mapping dict from KE-chain native pages to their Font Awesome icons.
* :+1: Added properties to retrieve the root Activity and Part objects of a Scope. (#799)
* :+1: Added bulk-clone of activities, including associated data models. (#737)
* :+1: Added `upload` input value for when creating basic- and filtered-grid widgets. (#814)

v3.7.6 (30JUN20)
----------------

* :star: Added the Weather Widget creating possibilities. #788
* :+1: dependent versions for development: tox (3.16.0)

v3.7.5 (29JUN20)
----------------

* :star: Added the Weather and GeoJSON property types to pykechain in correspondance with the backend version (core.pim 3.6.0). #787
* :+1: dependent versions for development: mypy (0.782), requests (2.24.0), nbsphinx (0.7.1), semver (2.10.2)

v3.7.4 (15JUN20)
----------------

* :bug: Reloading `Activity2` when retrieved in an `ActivityReferencesProperty` in order to populate it with all required data.
* :+1: dependent versions for development: sphinx (3.1.1), pytest-cov (2.10.0)

v3.7.3 (11JUN20)
----------------

* :+1: Added `autofill` representation for date, time and datetime properties (#733)
* :+1: Added `breadcrumb_root` option for meta-panel widgets.
* :+1: dependent versions for development: sphinx (3.1.0), flake8 (3.8.3), pre-commit (2.5.1)

v3.7.2 (8JUN20)
---------------
* :bug: fixed an issue where an old version of the dependent 'semantic versioning' package (`semver`) could cause problems. We now put a proper versioning requirement in the setup.py such that the correct version will be installed. Thanks for @bastiaan.beijer for finding this one.
* :+1: dependent versions for development: tox (3.15.2)

v3.7.1 (4JUN20)
---------------

* :bug: Reference properties values can now be set with identifiers, such as `property.value = "1234..."` and a list of identifiers, such as `property.value = ["1234..."]`. The original behavior of the `MultiReferenceProperty2` was inconsistent: the `value` attribute did not allow strings while updating via the `Part2.update()` and `Part2.add_with_properties()` methods allowed it. (#770)
* :+1: Enabled kwargs for bulk editing of activities. (#770)
* :+1: Assigned `Part2` class as the referenced class for the `MultiReferenceProperty2` for more precise type-checking. (#770)

v3.7.0 (3JUN20)
---------------

This is a big release and perfectly qualifies for a minor version number upgrade. We took care of many things and improvements in alignment with fresh and refreshed capabilities of the KE-chain 3 platform.

In this release we also deprecated functionality that were announced to be deprecated some time ago. We deprecated all compatibility to 'KE-chain 2'. Please refer to the Backward Incompatible Changes down below.

:star: is a new feature
:+1: are improvements
:bug: are fixed bugs./

* :star: Extracted representations from `Property2` class into a separate `RepresentationMixin` class. This is now utilized by the `Scope2`, `Activity2` and `Property2` classes.
* :star: Implemented `MultiSelectListProperty2` class, generalizing the implementation of the `SelectListProperty2 class. Intermediate class `_SelectListProperty` now hosts the generic implementation. #732
* :star: Implemented `ActivityReferencesProperty` class, generalizing the implementation of the part reference `MultiReferenceProperty2` class. Intermediate classes `_ReferenceProperty` and `_ReferencePropertyInScope` have been added for further reference properties. #746
* :star: Added `ScopeRoles` and `ScopeMemberActions` enum classes to list the roles of and operations on scope members.

* :+1: Added `PropertyTypes` enumeration values for the JSON property and multiple new reference properties.
* :+1: Added `CustomIconRepresentation` to change the font-awesome icons of KE-chain scopes and activities. Default icon display mode is set/gettable, defaulting to "regular".
* :+1: Added `show_name_column` input to the `add_supergrid_widget` method of the `WidgetsManager`.
* :+1: Added `show_download_button` and `show_full_screen_button` inputs to the `add_attachmentviewer_widget` method of the `WidgetsManager`.
* :+1: Added `link_value` input to the `add_card_widget` method of the `WidgetsManager`. Linking to sub-process activities now opens the link in tree view by default.
* :+1: Created mapping table `property_type_to_class_map` to convert between property types from the `PropertyType` enumeration and property classes derived from the `Property2` class.
* :+1: Added `BaseInScope` base class for KE-chain objects limited to a single scope. It inherits from `Base` itself. The new class is used for Parts, Properties, Activities, Widgets, Associations and Services. Original class is still used for Scopes, Teams, Users, Banners, Notifications and ServiceExecutions.
* :+1: Moved `scope` property method to the `BaseInScope` class, adding lazy retrieval to limit overhead.
* :+1: Improved robustness of teardown for tests for the `Scope2` class.
* :+1: Added `editable` argument to the `add_attachmentviewer_widget` method of the WidgetsManager, to enable both viewing and editing of the attachment.
* :+1: Added `show_log` argument to the `add_service_widget` method of the WidgetsManager, to separate the log file and log message.
* :+1: Added `Alignment` enum class, leaving `NavigationBarAlignment` as wrapper for backwards compatibility.
* :+1: Added intermediate `create_configured_widget` method in WidgetsManager  for widgets with associated properties.
* :+1: Moved all inherited `Property` methods into the `Property2` class and removed Property as its superclass.
* :+1: Large clean-up for user-input validation for most `Client` methods to provide consistent error messages.
* :+1: Added intermediate `_retrieve_singular` method in `Client` class to simplify other methods intended to get 1 object. These other methods all had identical dependency on methods to retrieve more than 1 object, such as `part()` on `parts()`.
* :+1: Improved traceback of any `APIError` by printing content from the `response` and/or `request` if provided by keyword arguments, e.g. `APIError("Incorrect value!", response=response)`. (#742)
* :+1: dependent versions for development: semver (2.10.1), pytest (5.4.3), pytest-cov(2.9.0), Sphinx (3.0.4), nbsphinx (0.7.0), tox (3.15.1), flake8 (3.8.2), pre-commit (2.4.0), mypy (0.780), removed PyOpenSSL which was only for python 2.7.

* :bug: Editing an `Activity2` now uses its `__init__` to refresh with the JSON from the response, removing an additional reload to get updated values.
* :bug: Added `Activity2.scope_id` setter method (self-induced bug due to the introduction of `BaseInScope`).
* :bug: Moved the serialization of property values from the `Part2._parse_update_dict()` method to the new `Property2.serialize_value()` method. This new method is used in the `_put_value()` method of this class to have identical serialization in both `value` and `part.update()` mechanics.
* :bug: The bulk update of property values via the `use_bulk_update` attribute and `update_values` method now uses the same serialization pipeline as synchronous updating. Also made the attribute a `Property2` class property, converting it to a singleton.
* :bug: Refactored the `reload` method of the `Client` class to be able to reload any Pykechain class object. #760
* :bug: Scope edit cleared some properties from the scope if they were not provided.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

We deprecated the following:

* `get_all_children` helper function for parts and activities. Use the `all_children` method instead.
* The `MultiReferenceProperty2.choices()` method now returns an empty list if no `Part` model is yet configured. Now the method no longer raises a TypeError (i.e. 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable).
* We deprecated the `ActivityTypes`: `USERTASK`, `SERVICETASK` and `SUBPROCESS` from `ActivityType` enum class.
* We deprecated the option to use `START` from `NavigationBarAlignment` enum class.
* We deprecated the mapping table `WIMCompatibleActivityTypes`.

v3.6.4 (20APR20)
----------------

* :bug: removed use of the old API usage of `descendants`. (#741)
* :+1: We will now raise the correct errors when retrieving an `active banner`. (#741)
* :+1: We now use actual depth-first sorting of children. (#741)
* :+1: For testing and development: Less hard-coded and centralized teardowns, using `assertEqual(expected, received)` format. (#741)
* :+1: dependent versions for development: Sphinx (3.0.2), nbsphinx (0.6.1)

v3.6.3 (14APR20)
----------------

* :+1: Added `current_user()` method on the Client class to return the `User` object of the user connected to KE-chain.
* :+1: Added various arguments to the `create_notification()` method.
* :+1: Added `edit()` method to the Notification class.
* :bug: Removed old API usage of `descendants` from `copy()` of the Part class.
* :bug: Raising correct errors whenever no (or multiple) active banner exist in the `active_banner()` method.

v3.6.2 (27MAR20)
----------------

* :bug: We found out that the regex to validate the email addresses was incorrectly defined. We added additional tests to fix this. (thanks to @jberends for the omission and the fix)

v3.6.1 (UNRELEASED)
-------------------

This was never released due to some inappropriate tagged.

v3.6.0 (26MAR20)
----------------

This minor releases adds two new concepts (:star: :star:) that also exist in the KE-chain backend. We added a `Banner` concept that allows powerusers
to set an announcement banner which is displayed (and can be dismissed) in KE-chain for all logged-in users within a certain timeperiod. We also added the concept of a `Notification` in KE-chain, where email or in-app notification can be displayed suchs as sharing a link of
a task to another user, or sharing a PDF of a task to another user or and external email address.

* :star: Implemented `Banner` model and methods to create, delete and retrieve them. #725 (Thanks to @jelleboersma for the implementation)
* :star: Added the concept of a `Notification` including the possibility to retrieve, create(send) and delete `Notifications`. #467 (thanks to @raduiordache for the implementation)
* :star: Added the possibility to share a link or PDF of an activity using the `Activity2.share_pdf()` or `Activity2.share_link()`. #467 (thanks to @raduiordache for the implementation)
* :bug: When adding a new `Activity2` to a parent, it will now cache its childeren in case the parent also have the children cached. In essence it updates the `_cached_children`. #722 (thanks to @jelleboersma)
* :+1: dependent versions for development: pytest (5.4.1), mypy (0.770), tox (3.14.6)

v3.5.4 (9MAR20)
---------------

* :star: implemented retry on connection errors for the `Client`. This will ensure that if the client connection to the server has been dropped, the client will retry the request again with an exponentional backoff not to overload. #714
* :+1: dependent versions for development: sphinx (2.4.4)

v3.5.3 (27FEB20)
----------------

This is release :100: of pykechain! That means :cake:!

* :bug: Fixed a bug where the API parameters for the `Service` now includes additional attributes on its objects. #709. Thanks to @bastiaanbeijer and @raduiordache for finding it and @jelleboersma for providing the fast resolution.

v3.5.2 (26FEB20)
----------------

* :bug: Fixed a bug in the multi references property where the call made to the backend with a normal user would require more information than only the id's of the parts, this resulted in an API error in the retrieval of the referred instances. #707 Thanks @BastiaanBeijer for the discovery and @JelleBoersma for the quick fix.
* :bug: `child()` method of Part2 now robustly retrieves child parts created after retrieval of the parent itself, regardless of the `_cached_children`.

v3.5.1 (25FEB20)
----------------

* :bug: Default widget title is now respected when widgets are created with `title=False`.
* :+1: Improved typing of `TreeObject` methods in its subclasses.

v3.5.0 (24FEB20)
----------------

This release brings some interesting changes to pykechain. We discovered suddenly that the `Activity` and `Part` where actual trees, being a sustainable company, we also implemented them as such. You will find additional helper methods on both models such as `child()`, `all_children()`, and `siblings()`. This release also bring many small updates from two 'bug hunting' pull requests.

* :star: Creation of `Widgets` without a title but with a reference (or `ref`) now supported via the `show_title_value` keyword.
* :star: Implemented `child` method for `Part2` and `Activity2` class. Also implemented "dunder" method `__call__()` as short-hand for `child()`, making tree searching much simpler to code, e.g: `child = root('part')('child')`
* :star: Creation of `Widgets` without a title but with a reference (or `ref`) now supported via the `show_title_value` keyword.
* :star: Added `Association` class and retrieval method `associations()` on the `Client` class.
* :bug: Creation of `Activity` now uses parent's `classification` if provided.
* :+1: Deprecated `get_all_children` helper function. It is replaced by the `all_children` method on the `Part2` and `Activity2` classes.
* :+1: Added `classification` attribute to the `Part2` class.
* :+1: Added caching of children to the `Activity2.children()` method.
* :+1: Moved creation of WidgetsManager instances from the `widgets()` method of the Client to Activity class. The Client's method output is now consistent with the `create_widget(s)` methods. #693
* :+1: Moved `delete_widget(s)` methods from WidgetsManager to Client class.
* :+1: Refactored Widget's `delete` method to now calls its WidgetManager, if available, to maintain a consistent Widget list.
* :+1: Added `__contains__` method to WidgetsManager to support "widget in manager" comparisons.
* :+1: Creation of `Activity` now uses parent's `classification` if provided.
* :+1: Added `page_size` input to the `add_scope_widget` method of the WidgetManager class to set the pagination of the `Scope` widget.
* :+1: dependent versions for development: sphinx (2.4.3), pre-commit (2.1.0), requests (2.23.0)

Backward incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `Client.widgets()` method now returns a list of `Widget` objects. In the past this was a `WidgetsManager` object that contained additional helper/widgetfactory methods to instantiate a widget. This is now brought in line with other `Client` widget methods like `Client.create_widget()`, etc. (reg #693)


3.4.0 (17FEB20)
---------------

* :star: Added `Client` method for the bulk-update properties API endpoint. #663
* :star: Added `Property2` flag `use_bulk_update` and class method `update_values` to support bulk-update of property values while still using the `value` attribute. #663
* :bug: `has_value` method of the `Property2` class now accurately predicts floats, integers and boolean values. #675
* :bug: `value` attribute of `AttachmentProperty` class now refreshes automatically when uploading attachments. #675
* :+1: moved bulk-update of widgets to the client. Also split the `_validate_widget` and the `_validate_related_models` Client methods. #658
* :+1: Updated `populate_descendants()` to use new API and actually store the `_cached_children`.
* :+1: Added test to confirm a value of `None` clears a reference property. #468
* :+1: Keyword-arguments provided when creating widgets via the `WidgetsManager` do now propagate successfully.
* :+1: Improved unittests for `Property2`, `AttachmentProperty2` classes.
* :+1: dependent versions for development: semver (2.9.1), coveralls (1.11.1), Sphinx (2.4.1), tox (3.14.5)

3.3.2 (6FEB20)
--------------
* :bug: `Activity2` method `_validate_edit_arguments` now correctly checks for members of the scope prior to assigning new assignees.
* :star: added thousand separators representation on numeric properties to pykechain. #670 (thanks to @raduiordache)
* :+1:Fix the `Widget.parent()` method call. #655
* :+1:Updated `populate_descendants()` to use new API and actually store the `_cached_children`. #662
* :+1: dependent versions for development: pydocstlye (5.0.2), nbsphinx (0.5.1), pytest (5.3.5), pre-commit (2.0.1)

3.3.1 (8JAN20)
--------------
* Fixed a lingering performance issue with `Part.add_with_properties()`. In older KE-chain API versions a full part refresh was needed in order to re-retrieve the attributes of a `Part`. In the current backend API this is not needed anymore. The attribute that caused this was the `refresh` flag in the `Part.add_with_properties` method call and resulted in the re-retrieval of all children of a part and caused longer cycle times once the list of children grows longer (linear). This flag will be deprecated in the next release. Currently all Parts are automatically refreshed with information from the backend in a lightweight manner (without an extra API call). The part just created with the method `add_with_properties` is added to the `Part`'s children automatically if the children of the parent are already once retrieved (and cached). Many thanks to our committed users / customers for finding this and pointing this out.
* Updated type hinting for all methods for `Part2` objects, to assist the user in capable Python Development Environments (IDE's - such as Pycharm or VSCode) to write error-free code.
* Added a Pending Deprecation Warning when setting the `refresh` attribute on the `Part.add_with_properties(refresh=False/True)`. It will be removed in version 3.4 and an DeprecationWarning Exception will be raised then.

3.3.0 (7JAN20)
--------------
* Added scope widget button customization in the `WidgetManager` method `add_scope_widget`.
* Added native KE-chain pages as option for the `Card` widget `link` value. Use the `KEChainPages` enum to set your target.
* Added `show_images` to the inputs of `add_supergrid_widget` and `add_filteredgrid_widget` methods.
* Organized function headers of the `WidgetManager` methods to match the order of the inputs.
* Added `edit_cascade_down` method to the `Activity2` class to trickle-down the changes to the attributes of a subprocess.
* Added `APP` classification options to the tasks to actively work on the `APP` screens (not end-user editable)
* Added support of Python 3.7 and 3.8 in sim scripts to support future unlocking of this feature in KE-chain 3.2 (FEB20).

3.2.4 (6JAN20)
--------------
* Feature: migrating `async` to `async_mode` for all backend api's for future compatibility. Determines if backend lives on version 3.1.0 or above. (#649)
* dependent versions for development: coveralls (1.10.0), Sphinx (2.3.1), mypy (0.761), tox (3.14.3), pre-commit (1.21.0)

3.2.3 (19DEC19)
---------------
* :bug: copying of (multiple) `1-or-many` `Part` models to the same parent is now fixed. #636 Thanks to @jelleboersma
* :bug: copy/move of a `Part` also refreshes the part to ensure all properties are copied/moved. #636
* :point_up: dependent versions for development: pytest (5.3.2), coverage (pinned to < 5.0), Sphinx (2.3.0), mypy (0.760)

3.2.2 (14DEC19)
---------------
* made `Activity.associated_parts()` great again. #523 Thanks to @raduiordache
* Added also the possibility to get the associated objects of an `Activity` with ids only. #523
* Updated dependent versions for development: pydocstyle (5.0.1)

3.2.1 (06DEC19)
---------------
This is the day after 'Sinterklaasavond' :gift: edition of pykechain.

 * Update the `Client.create_widgets` (bulk create widgets) and `Client.update_widgets_associations` (bulk update widget associations) to work seamlessly with the backend on it as we discovered a bug in the backend during tests of these methods. Additional tests where added as well. #617, #626
 * Added `SideBarManager` and `SideBarButton` classes to support configuration of the scope side-bar. #539
 * Added Enumeration classes `KEChainPages`, `SubprocessDisplayMode`, `URITarget` and `FontAwesomeMode` to support configuration of the scope side-bar. #539
 * Added `is_url` url checker, with a tap to the :tophat: for Konsta Vesterinen and his implementation of an URL validator. #539
 * Added pre commit hooks for developers. Use `pre-commit install` to install the hooks in your local repo and while committing, watch your git console (in Pycharm in the 'Version Control' tab (bottom) > 'Console' tab). If you want to run the pre-commit hooks on all files (not only those ones that changes in the commit) run `pre-commit run -a` on the command line (Terminal).

3.2.0 (03DEC19)
---------------
 * Added bulk widget creation and editing of widgets. #617 (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * Added methods to retrieve pykechain objects from the server via 'ref'. Including services. #608. (thanks to @raduiordache)
 * Added `edit` and `delete` methods to `Team` class and fixed some bugs relating to `Team` creation. #620 (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * Added additional inputs to create an `Activity`: `status`, `start_date`, `due_date`, `description`, `classification`. #615 (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * Bugfix: `Part.scope()` retrieves the part's scope regardless of its status. (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * Improved `Client` exception messages when retrieving singular objects, e.g. `Client.scope()` (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: mypy (0.750), tox (3.14.2), sphinx (2.2.2), coveralls (1.9.2 :vulcan_salute:️)

3.1.5 (29NOV19)
---------------
This is the black friday edition of pykechain.

 * Changed the default upload of a sim script to use python 3.6 when executed on KE-chain as a script.
 * Added tests for retrieving objects by `ref`. (#608 - thanks to @jelleboersma for the find and @raduiordache for the PR)
 * Updated the implementation of the `add_scope_widget()` method to support filters. (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: twine (3.1.1), pytest (5.3.1)

3.1.4 (25NOV19)
---------------
 * Updated the implementation of the `Scope.members()` method when dealing with `is_leadmember` and `is_manager` filters. (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * Updated CI tests to use Github Actions.

3.1.3 (22NOV19)
---------------
 * Fixed the bulk editing and creating of parts (`Part2`) which have attachments in the list of properties. In the background we now separate the upload of attachments from the update of the properties. #590 (Thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * Fixed a bug with timezones.
 * Updated dependent versions for development: nbsphinx (0.5.0), pytest (5.3.0), jsonschema (3.2.0), twine (3.0.0), pyopenssl (19.1.0).

3.1.2 (14NOV19)
---------------
 * small fix for backwards compatibility of `CardWidgetLinkTarget` enum.

3.1.1 (UNRELEASED)
------------------
 * This version is never released to the public

3.1.0 (14NOV19)
---------------
 * Added `Activity2.move()` function to move an Activity somewhere else under another Activity into this code base. (#579 thanks to @raduiordache)
 * Created a framework for Property Representation, similar to the ones provided in KE-chain. Using this framework you can add representation for e.g. the SelectList, such as shown as a dropdown, checkboxes or a button. Check out the documentation on `SelectListRepresentations`. We also added `DecimalPlaces`, `SignificantDigits`, `LinkTarget` and `ButtonRepresentation`. (#532 thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * Added `FileSizeValidator` and `FileExtensionValidator` to pykechain. Now you can use it also to create these validators for `AttachmentProperty2`-ies. Also if these validators are active on properties you can use the `Property2.is_valid()` api to check if the property conforms to these validators. With `Property2.get_reason()` you retrieve the reason for the validator being either valid or invalid. This will override the patch release of 3.0.2. #573
 * Added `ImageFitValue` enum to better support the `CardWidget` and `AttachmentviewerWidget` generation and editing. #582 (thanks @jelleboersma)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: tox (3.14.1)

3.0.2 13NOV19
-------------
 * Ensured proper handling of filesize and fileextension validators in KE-chain. This is a temporary release for compatibility reasons. It will be replaced with fully blown Validators in the next release. (thanks to @bastiaanbeijer for finding it)

3.0.1 12NOV19
-------------
As we dropped Python 2.7 support we improve the code throughout on type hinting and type checking. We do this for
better code and code that is less prone to errors while developing python applications on top of KE-chain
with pykechain. This release improves the code in several places in this regard.

 * (for developers) Additional type checking and type hinting consistencies fixed (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * (for developers) added enumerations inheritance (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * small fix for the `Client.user()` methods that expects a `id` keyword in the backend and got a `pk`. (thanks to @jelleboersma)
 * refactored the `update_dict` for bulk actions where `fvalues` can be used such as part create with properties and part update with properties (thanks to @jelleboersma)

3.0.0 31OKT19
-------------

This is a next major release of pykechain, adding support for the legacy version of the Product Information Module (PIM) in KE-chain as well as the new version PIM3.

Backward Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* this version is incompatible with Python version 2.7. It will produce a `RunTimeError` when trying to execute this in ``Python 2.7``. This is due to the fact we added Python 3 type hints to the source code to improve stability.
* When connecting to KE-chain version 2 API backends, please refer to ``pykechain version 2.7``. This versions attempts to autodetect the version of the API and switch to legacy classes and methods accordingly, but YMMV. In your requirements you can place the following line: ``pykechain <= 2.7.99`` to ensure that the latest pykechain v2 is installed.

Major differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Widgets are not part of KE-chain 3. The `Activity` object does provide a `WidgetManager` to add, remove, reorder, insert and manage `WidgetSets` in general.
 * There are some new widgets introduced, please refer to `the documentation <https://pykechain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_api.html>`_
 * We have a new `Part2`, `Property2` and `Scope2` API endpoint (``/api/v3/...``). This API is faster but asks the call to be more explicit on what fields to return initially.
 * KE-chain 3 has widget level associations, and not on activity anymore. That means that parts and part models are associated per widget.
 * We made over 300 commits with updates, improvements and changes in relation to pykechain v2.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Added `clone_scope()` method to the `Client` and the `Scope` object. With the right permissions you can now clone a project using pykechain.
 * We added 'representation' for some property types in the KE-chain 3 backend. In such way we can support alternative representations of eg. single select list as a list of buttons in the frontend, greatly improving the usability on mobile devices.
 * More consistent handling of pykechain base objects throughout the code. Now you can pass in a pykechain Base subclassed object almost anywhere, where in the past you could only have passed only the UUID/id.
 * We added `ref` to most pykechain models. You can find `Properties` of a `Part` based on the `id`, `name` or `ref` now. You can also search most models for its `ref`. The `ref` is a slugified value of the original name of the object in KE-chain.
 * We enabled the options `check_certificates` in the `pykechain.helpers.get_project()` function and the `Client`. You can use this to disable the check for https certificates in pykechain, eg. to connect to the local HTTPS host or to a on-premise host that has a self-assigned certificate.
 * We added a `DatetimeProperty` to more precisely manage the conversion of datetimes back and forth with the API.
 * We added type hints on most, if not all major methods.
 * We updated the documentation.
 * We test pykechain version 3 against python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and pypy3 - and naturally all tests pass.

2.7.0 (31OKT19)
---------------

.. warning::

---------------
 * Added additional properties for the `Service` and `ServiceExecution` class. Now you can retrieve the `Service.filename` amoungst others. Please refer to the documentation of `Service` and `ServiceExecution` to see the properties that are now available (a feature request by @JelleBoersma). #480
 * We added a utility function to `parse_datetime` strings into `datetime` objects. These strings are in a json response from the KE-chain backend and are now properly translated and timezoned. #482
 *  Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (4.4.1), mypy (0.701), tox (3.9.0).

2.5.6 (13APR19)

 * Updated dependent versions for development: requests (2.20.1), sphinx (1.8.2), pytest (4.0.1), requests (2.20.0), matplotlib (3.0.2)

2.5.1 (05NOV18)
---------------
 * patch release to include the dependency pytz in the normal list of dependencies, not only for development.

2.5.0 (1NOV18)
--------------
 * Added the ability to set and retrieve the scope tags using the `Scope.tags` property. (#367)
 * Added timezone, language and email to the user object. You can access this directly as a property on the `User` object. (#378)
 * Ensured that you can now filter users on their name, username and email. (#373)
 * Added the possibility to generate a PDF from an activity even with attachments included. The later is an async process on the KE-chain server and pykechain uses a 'hint' to retrieve the PDF once it becomes available on the server. It has an timeout of 100 seconds. (#406)
 * included many updated tests for the copy_move functionality including cross reference properties. (#376)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: semver (2.8.1), pydocstyle (3.0.0), mypy (0.641), requests (2.20.0), flake8 (3.6.0), matplotlib (3.0.1), pytest (3.9.3), tox (3.5.3)

---------------
 * Added the `Team` concept. You can now query the API to retrieve `Teams` using `client.team(name='My own team')`. You can also now `Team.add_members` and `Team.remove_members` with their `TeamRoles`. (#391)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: twine (1.12.1)

2.3.3 (24SEP18)
---------------
 * Fixed an issue with the `scope.edit()` method. It will handle now the assignment of the team with a `team_id` correctly. Thanks @stefan.vanderelst (#388)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: tox (3.4.0), pytest (3.8.1), sphinx (1.8.1)

2.3.2 (19SEP18)
---------------

 * Additional widgets are introduced in KE-chain or in the process of being introduced, so we updated the enumerations. In this process we also updated the jsonschema of the widget to check against before uploading a customization to KE-chain (#369)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: tox (3.2.1), pytest (3.8.0), nbsphinx (0.3.5), sphinx (1.8.0), mypy (0.630) and matplotlib (3.0.0)

2.3.1 (2AUG18)
--------------
 * The details of a scope can now be edited using `Scope.edit()` method. This contains action already prepared for the KE-chain 2.16.0-143 release (Mid August). (#357)

    For example:

     >>> from datetime import datetime
     >>> project.edit(name='New project name',description='Changing the description just because I can',start_date=datetime.utcnow(),status=ScopeStatus.CLOSED)

  * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.7.0)

    For example:

     >>> from datetime import datetime
     >>> project.edit(name='New project name',description='Changing the description just because I can',start_date=datetime.utcnow(),status=ScopeStatus.CLOSED)

  * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.7.0)

    For example:

     >>> from datetime import datetime
     >>> project.edit(name='New project name',description='Changing the description just because I can',start_date=datetime.utcnow(),status=ScopeStatus.CLOSED)

  * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.7.0)

    For example:

     >>> from datetime import datetime
     >>> project.edit(name='New project name',description='Changing the description just because I can',start_date=datetime.utcnow(),status=ScopeStatus.CLOSED)

  * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.7.0)

   For example:

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> project.edit(name='New project name',
    ...              description='Changing the description just because I can',
    ...              start_date=datetime.utcnow(),  # naive time is interpreted as UTC time
    ...              status=ScopeStatus.CLOSED)

 * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.7.0)

2.3.0 (26JUl18)
---------------
 * We added additional utilities to help pykechain script developers to `Part.copy()`, `Part.move()` and `Part.clone()` part models and part instances. (#343)

For example; To move part models, their children (subtree) and their instances:

    >>> model_to_move = project.model(name='Model to be moved')
    >>> bike = project.model('Bike')
    >>> model_moved = model_to_move.move(target_parent=bike, name='Moved model',
    >>>                                  include_children=True,
    >>>                                  include_instances=True)

 * We added show headers and show columns in the arguments of the property grid to align to KE-chain functionality of the widget. (#350)
 * We added the posibility to use a JSON widget to the list of allowed widgets. (#351)
 * We added the posibility to update the options of a reference property. (#352)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.6.3), tox (3.1.2), sphinx (1.7.6), mypy (0.620)

2.2.4 (22JUN18)
---------------
 * An issue was fixed where the `suppress_kevents` flag was not correctly injected in the API request for all functions that created parts. (#340)
 * Changed the way the cached children are stored when the `Part.children()` method is used. It is now cached as a `List` instead of a `Partset` and you can iterate over the `List` many times in your application. Thanks to Jelle Boersma for finding this. (#341)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.6.2), mypy (0.610), requests (2.19.1)

2.2.3 (5JUN18)
--------------
 * An issue was fixed in the `Activity2.siblings()` function. It now returns the actual siblings (other children of the common parent (subprocess)) for WIM2 based Activities. Thanks to @bastiaanbeijer for finding it, thanks to @raduiordache for fixing it. (#332)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.6.1), semver (2.8.0), pyopenssl (18.0.0), sphinx (1.7.5)

2.2.2 (27MAY18)
---------------
 * We fixed an issue with the pdf download option to ensure that the attachements property is passed as well in preparation for the async pdf downloader release in KE-chain 2.13.0-140 (#329). Found and fixed by @raduiordache; thanks!

2.2.1 (23MAY18)
---------------
 * We ensured that old pykechain code to create a property model when not using the `PropertyType` enums is still compatible with changes introduced in version 1.16.0 (MAR18). We improved the documentation for `Client.create_property()` and `enums.PropertyTypes`. Using 'CHAR' (pre 1.16 style) instead of 'CHAR_VALUE' (enum style) will result in a warning (with suggestion to change this) for old code and will be corrected. Using an invalid `property_type` will result in an `IllegalArgumentError`. (#326)

2.2.0 (14MAY18)
---------------

Major feature: Property validators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * We added support for validators to KE-chain v2.12.0-139 and pykechain. Validators objects are stored on a property and can be used to validate the value of a property. The validator objects are also visualised in the KE-chain frontend. (#317)

Validators have a representation in the frontend of KE-chain 2 (see also documentation on: https://support.ke-chain.com/). The validators are stored on the `Property` object and currently the following validators are implemented:

 * :class:`NumericRangeValidator`: When you provide a range, the validate can check if the value of the property is within range. It can even check a stepsize. See the documentation for :class:`NumericRangeValidators`. A representation in KE-chain is available when the value does not conform to this range.
 * :class:`RequiredFieldValidator`: When you add this to a property (model), the property validates when a value is provided. There is a representation in KE-chain frontend available.
 * :class:`RegexStringValidator`: A special validation to check a string (eg textfield) against a regex pattern. There *no representation in KE-chain 2 in version v2.12.0-138*.
 * :class:`OddNumberValidator` and :class:`EvenNumberValidator`: a validator that checks a numeric field (decimal or integer field) if it is an even or odd number. There *no representation in KE-chain 2 in version v2.12.0-138*.
 * :class:`SingleReferenceValidator`: a special validator that ensures that there can only be a single referenced part selected in a (multi) reference property.

To validate the property object there are several new functions available. :meth:`Property.validate()` to validate all validators attached to the property using the :attr:`Property.value` as basis for the validation. You will be provided back a resulting list with all validations including their validation reason.

To only check if the Property and its value conforms to the list of Validators, use the :attr:`Property.is_valid` and :attr:`Property.is_invalid` properties.

To retrieve the :class:`PropertyValidator` objects that are stored on the `Property` use the property :meth:`Property.validators`. You can set a list of :class:`PropertyValidator` objects to this property as well, which will be stored on the `Property` in KE-chain using an API call.

To add validators to a property (model)::

    >>> bike_model = project.model(name='Bike')  # type: Part
    >>> electric_range = bike_model.property('electric_range')  # type: Property
    >>> range = NumericRangeValidator(minvalue=0, maxvalue=100)  # instantiate a range validation between 0 and 100
    >>> reqd = RequiredFieldValidator()  # instantiate a requiredFieldValidator
    >>> electric_range.validators = [range, reqd]  # save the validators on the property to KE-chain

To validate a value against a validator::

    >>> bike = project.part(name='Bike')  # type: Part
    >>> electric_range = bike.property('electric_range')  # type: Property
    >>> electric_range.value
    None
    >>> electric_range.is_valid  # No value set, invalid according to the requiredFieldValidator
    False
    >>> electric_range.value = 50
    >>> electric_range.is_valid  # Value is provided AND value is within the range (0, 100)
    True
    >>> electric_range.value = -1
    >>> electric_range.is_valid  # However, the value itself is invalid according to the range validation
    False
    >>> electric_range.validate(reason=True)  # use the explicit validation
    [(False, "Value '-1' should be between 0 and 100"), (True, "Value is provided")]


For more documentation of Validators, please refer to the API documentation at: http://pykechain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_api.html

Fixes and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * A fix was made for the the `Part.populate_descendants()` to be working for part of category `MODEL` too. Thanks to a fix of @raduiordache. (#320)


2.1.1 (10APR18)
---------------
 * We fixed an issue with the caching of the children of a `Part` when you retrieve children with additional filters on it. (#312)

2.1.0 (6APR18)
--------------
 * We added an optimisation to the `Part`. When you use the `Part.children()` method, the children are cached for later re-retrieval. In order to boost performance even more, you can use the `Part.populate_descendants()` function to pre-populate all children for the whole subparttree inside the `Part`. You can easily then access its children without further expensive API calls. (#306)
 * We brought the capabilities of the Text Widget up to specification with the KE-chain 2.10 release. We can now also provide and set the collapsed initial state of the text widget (#310). Thanks to @raduiordache.
 * We added a function to download an activity as PDF (#286). Thanks to @raduiordache.
 * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.5.0), mypy (0.580), nbsphinx (0.3.2), tox (3.0.0), matplotlib (2.2.2), twine (1.11.0), shpinx (1.7.2)

2.0.0 (14MAR18)
---------------

This is a major release of pykechain, adding support for the legacy version of the Workflow Information Module (WIM) in KE-chain as well as the new version WIM2. Based on the version number of the WIM, either an `Activity` or an `Activity2` class is provided.

Major differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main diferences in the concepts between WIM1 `Activity` and WIM2 `Activity2` are:

 * In WIM1: The root object is not an `Activity`, while in WIM2 the root object is an `Activity2`. Use predicates such as `is_root` to check this.
 * In WIM1, an `Activity` that exist of the rootlevel, returns a `NotFoundError` when you search for its parent (using the `subprocess()` or `parent` method). In WIM2 you will get the root object back. Use the predicate `is_rootlevel` to help you assess if the `Activity` is indeed on the root level of the project.
 * In WIM1, the types of activity are actually called a `activity_class`, while in WIM2 this is called an `activity_type`. A `UserTask` in WIM1 is a `TASK` in WIM2, and a `Subprocess` in WIM1 is a `PROCESS` in WIM2. The `enums.ActivityTypes` are updated accordingly.
 * In WIM1, the assignees where to be assigned using usernames, in WIM2 user_ids need to be provided. For the sake of compatibility pykechain helps you in this. You can provide usernames to a `Activity2.edit()` and it is automatically translated in user_ids with additional calls to KE-chain.

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Revamped the activity API endpoints and functionality to work with the new WIM2 implementation of KE-chain 2.10 (MAR18)
 * Added a number of predicated on the `Activity` object to simplify the introspection of the Activity, eg. `is_rootlevel`, `is_root`, `is_workflow`...
 * We added a translation layer that automatically detects if you connect to WIM1 or WIM2 and automagically translates `activity_class` and `activity_type` and the assigneesids (in lieu of usernames).
 * Added the `Actvity2.parent()` function to retrieve the parent (in lieu for `subprocess()`)
 * Added `User` object in pykechain to check the users in a KE-chain instance.
 * KE-chain for WIM2 added also a version endpoint to check the version of the individual KE-chain 'apps' such as WIM. It is used to automatically give you back the Activity class based on the version you are using. You can check out the `client.app_versions` property.
 * Fixed the way you limit the scope search in Scope.activities() and Scope.activity()

Backward incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Deprecated the 'inspector components' including its base classes.
 * Deprecated the 'single reference property', which is replaced by the `MultiReference` property.

Pending Deprecation Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * In May 2018 we will deprecate the support of WIM1 in pykechain. `PendingDeprecationWarnings` are in place when you use WIM1 `Activity`.

1.16.0 (14MAR18)
------------------
This is the last release in preparation for the WIM2 release of KE-chain and consequently pykechain. In the next version of pykechain, some backward incompatible changes will happen. A migration path is provided as well.

 * Implemented new functions for adding the following widgets: `Basic table`, `Paginated table`, `JSON`, `Script`, `Notebook`, `Text`, `Attachment viewer` and `Navigation Bar`. (#280)
 * Added two new enums (`SortTable` and `NavigationBarAlignment`) which can be used when adding new widgets. (#280)
 * Added additional enums `WidgetNames` for the proper names of the widgets in the customisation dialog in KE-chain. (#280)
 * Updated the documentation regarding Property Types. (#280)
 * Fixed the enums so they now work correctly for each `PropertyType`. (#280)
 * Wrote a test that tests each property type (we didn't have this before). This will increase the test coverage to ~95% for KE-chain. (#280)
 * Added a new function called `Client.property()`, which allows the user to retrieve one property. (#296)
 * Improved the overall test coverage for `ExtCustomization` class to 100%.
 * increased the coverage of `MultiReference` property tests to 100%. (#296)
 * increased the coverage of `SelectListProperty` tests to 100%. (#296)
 * setting the value of a `SelectListProperty` instance to None empties it.
 * increased the coverage of `Scope` tests to 100%. (#296)
 * increased the coverage of `Client` tests to 99%. (#296)
 * increased the coverage of `Service` tests to 90%. (#296)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: betamax (0.8.1), twine (1.10.0), matplotlib (2.2.0), pytest (3.4.2), mypy (0.570), sphinx (1.7.1)


1.15.4 (15FEB18)
----------------
 * Fixed an issues where the `MultiReference` property did not provide the correct choices. Also fixed a bug where the setting of the value is now performed more robust. (#282)

1.15.3 (8FEB18)
---------------
 * Fixed a bug where the `MultiReference` property only provided back the 'last' `Part` in the internal value due to the way a library parses a list. Fixed that and added tests (#276). Thanks again to @raduiordache.

1.15.2 (5FEB18)
---------------
 * Fixed a bug where the `MultiReference` property could not retrieve parts through the API based on the value of the `MultiReference` property as it incorrectly retrieved the 'id' from the value list (#274). Thanks to @raduiordache!

1.15.1 (2FEB18)
---------------
 * The `Part.property()` method was slightly changed in 1.15 (the argument name was `name` and became `name_or_id`). This is reverted to `name` to be compatible with older pykechain releases. (#271)
 * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.4.0)

1.15.0 (25JAN18)
----------------
 * added ability to provide additional `keyword=value` arguments to many of the part and property methods that either create parts or update properties (#260). This facilitates the use of `suppress_kevents=True` that you might want to use for a backend performance boost. This is a trade-off that the frontend will not be informed of any property updates or new parts until after a reload of the page in the KE-chain frontend application. When you *can use* `suppress_kevents=True` in the method, it is documented in the function. This can be found in de `Developer API docs <http://pykechain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_api.html>`_. Examples of functions that can handle the `supress_kevents=True` as additional `keyword=value` argument are: `Client.create_part()`, `Client.create_model()`, `Part.add()`, `Part.update()`, `Part.edit()` and more like these.
 * added validation of a single select list. The value is not set when it is not in the list of options (#259).
 * enabled to use of property model UUID in the `Part.add_with_properties()` next to using property names. (#258)
 * enabled to search for properties using UUID next to using property names. This is provided for you in `Part.property()`.
 * The `Part.update()` is now considerate if you provide the property UUIDs inside the `update_dict` as well as property names. You can even mix UUIDs and property names together. (#263) Thanks to @raduiordache.
 * functions and methods that check if the correct type was provided to the method as arguments that raised `TypeError` before, are now raising `IllegalArgumentError`.
 * The `Activity.customize()` method and the `InspectorComponents` are now deprecated (since Nov 17) and will raise deprecation errors when called. Use `Activity.customization()` to retrieve the new activity Customization objects.
 * updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.3.2), sphinx (1.6.6), nbsphinx (0.3.1), matplotlib (2.1.2), mypy (0.560)
 * updated documentation with additional crosslinks and better references.
 * added source code to all API documentation

1.14.0 (11DEC17)
----------------
 * In preparation for the release of KE-chain 2.7.0-132, we added support for multireference properties in pykechain. Pykechain 1.14 is compatible with both older versions of KE-chain as well as the ones supporting multireference properties. The main difference is that you need to provide a list of `Part`s or `part_id`s instead of a single `Part` or `part_id`. It will override the value in KE-chain fully, no adding or substraction methods are provided, you need to do that in your own code.
 * Updated documentation for the `MultiReferenceProperty`.
 * updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.3.1)

1.13.3 (5DEC17)
---------------
 * added the 'type' attribute to a property (#248)
 * updated the enums documentation to include all the possible enums available (#247)

1.13.2 (4DEC17)
---------------
 * A wrong statuscode check prevented the upload of a script to complete fully in pykechain. The script is properly uploaded, but pykechain checked against wrong code (#246).
 * updated dependent versions for development: pyopenssl (17.5.0), pytest (3.3.0), nbsphinx (0.2.18)

1.13.1 (16NOV17)
----------------
 * Added additional xtypes to the list of allowed xtypes in the customizations in order to support our new widgets. (#240)
 * updated dependent versions for development: pytest (3.2.5)

1.13 (9NOV17)
-------------
 * Added `Service` and `ServiceExecution` models to pykechain (#231). This includes the ability to `create`, `retrieve`, `edit`, `destroy` and `upload` kecpkg files to KE-chain. Also the `retrieve`, `terminate`, and `download log` results for `ServiceExecution`s (which are associated to `Service`s) are available. This brings `pykechain` in line with the full abilities in KE-chain 2 SIM release (31OKT17) (SIM module license needed). Also see the PyPI package `kecpkg-tools` from KE-works to help you smoothen the workflow of creating custom KE-chain supported python packages (`kecpkg`) that can be executed by the KE-chain SIM module.
 * Added additional keywords arguments in the scope and activity searchers. You can now craft complex search queries to the KE-chain API (#231)
 * Prevented the creation of Activities with incorrect activity_class. This is now prevented in pykechain (#225)
 * Added an option for all models to `reload` (will return a new object) and `refresh` (will update in place). (#232)
 * Added additional tests and improved documentation for `Service` and `ServiceExecution` models.
 * updated dependent versions for development: matplotlib (2.1.0), nbsphinx (0.2.16), flake8 (3.5.0), sphinx (1.6.5), mypy (0.540), pydocstyle (2.1.1)

1.12.9 (5OCT17)
---------------
 * Improved scope control for activity queries. Will ensure that the scope_id of an acitivity is properly retrieved and checked for in case of subqueries such as `Activity.children()`, `siblings`, `subprocess`.
 * Updated dependent versions for development: pytest updated to 3.2.3 (#215)

1.12.8 (2OCT17)
---------------
 * Fixed a bug where the scope object was ambigously retrieved during the edit assignees of an activity action. It failed when the scope was closed. Thanks to @raduiordache for its find! (#211)
 * Updated dependent versions for development for tox to 2.9.1 and Sphinx to 1.6.4 (#198, #209)

1.12.7 (2OCT17)
---------------
 * Fixed a bug where a model without an instance raises an incorrect Error. Now it will raise a `NotFoundError` (#207).

1.12.6 (28SEP17)
----------------
 * Fixed a bug in the `models.customisation`. After a succesfull save of a customisation to an activity, the activity could not be retrieved from KE-chain if the activity was part of a closed scope (#205).

1.12.5 (28SEP17)
----------------
 * The `get_project()` helper method will now retrieve a scope a status other than 'ACTIVE' only (#203).
 * Updated the documentation to fix wrongly formatted examples.

1.12.4 (26SEP17)
----------------
 * Fixed a bug in the customization code by which the activity was incorrectly updated after a correctly saved customization to the KE-chain server. In some cases the incorrect customisation was retrieved on name basis, which may resulted in an error raised. Thanks to @raduiordache for finding it (#200).
 * Added `**kwargs` to the `Part.children()`, `Part.siblings()`, `Part.instances()`, `Activity.children()`, and `Activity.siblings()` methods. This will enable more comprehensive searches, eg. by the name of children using `Activity.children(name='Some childs name')` (#199).

1.12.3 (21SEP17)
----------------
 * Fixing the warning: 'could not any envfile' from envparse. Which is suppressed for cosmetics. It is advised to provide a pathname for the envfile when you want to load the environment variables from an envfile (#195).
 * Fixed tests for the envparse warning and refactored the tests to better deal with in-test settings of the environment.

1.12.2 (15SEP17)
----------------
 * Removed a logical error in the checking of the existing of the environment variables.

1.12.1 (15SEP17)
----------------
 * Added the ability to enforce the use of environment variables when the KECHAIN_FORCE_ENV_USE is set to a true value in the environment. Altered documentation and altered tests for that (#193).

1.12 (14SEP17)
--------------
 * Added a new helper `get_project()` to bootstrap a pykechain client and return a project (aka Scope) immediately. You can retrieve a project using direct arguments `url`, `token` (or `username` and `password`), and `scope_id` (or `scope` name). Alternatively, you can provide an `.env` file or provide the arguments from the environment as the environment variables `KECHAIN_URL`, `KECHAIN_TOKEN` (or `KECHAIN_USERNAME` and `KECHAIN_PASSWORD`), and `KECHAIN_SCOPE_ID` (or `KECHAIN_SCOPE`) (#185). This is ideal for `pykechain` scripts in the KE-chain SIM, as we provide support for this to make your scripting experience in KE-chain buttersmooth. An example:

    >>> from pykechain import get_project
    >>> project = get_project(url='http://localhost:8000', username='foo', password='bar', scope='Bike Project')
    >>> print(project.name)

 * Added additional checks for the `Client` to check if the url provided is correct (#185).
 * Improved the state of the project on codacy, a nice code quality monitor, from B to A grade. Removed over 100 insecure code elements, according to codacy. See: https://www.codacy.com/app/KE-works/pykechain/dashboard (#187).
 * Updated dependent versions of pyopenssl to 1.1.2 (#188), pytest to 3.2.2 (#183) and tox to 2.8.2 (#184).
 * Updated coverage of the files to internal standards. The critical models are now 100% tested such as the `Client`, `Activity` and `Part`. (#190) see: https://coveralls.io/github/KE-works/pykechain.

1.11.1 (4SEP17)
---------------
 * Added the ability to clear and attachment field (unlink the attachment). Please refer to the `AttachmentProperty.clear()` method.
 * Ensured a more robust updating of property value all over by altering `Property._value` and `Property._json_data['value']` after you set a value on a property.

1.11 (4SEP17)
-------------
 * In KE-chain 2.5 the way we use task customization has changed drastically. Pykechain (from 1.11 onwards) supports this by implementing a new concept in the activity called `Activity.customization()` (#161). This provides you an `ExtCustomization` object, which you can inspect and add new widgets. Please see the documentation on `ExtCustomization` and `Activity.customization()` for more details. An example to use is:

    >>> activity = project.activity(name='Customizable activity')
    >>> customization = activity.customization()
    >>> part_to_show = project.part(name='Bike')
    >>> customization.add_property_grid_widget(part_to_show, custom_title="My super bike"))

 * Removed previously announced deprecated method for `activity.create_activity()` (use `Activity.create()`).
 * Added deprecation warnings when using `InspectorComponent` objects and old style `Customization` components. They will be removed in November 2017 (introduced in pykechain 1.9)
 * Added the ability to retrieve a list of project members and managers with the `Scope.members()` method (#169)
 * Added the ability to manage member and managers of a scope. See the `Scope.add_member`, `add_manager`, `remove_member`, `remove_manager` (#175)
 * Added the ability to add additional keyword arguments for the methods `Part.update()`, `Part.add_with_properties()` and `Part.edit()`. This will allow to provide additional (including undocumented) arguments to the KE-chain API. (eg. 'suppress_kevents=True') (#177)
 * Added the ability to edit the name of the property, its description and the unit (#146, PR #179)
 * Added classification enumeration (#175)
 * Updated the documentation structure to better access all the pykechain models related documentation. See http://pykechain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_api.html
 * Updated dependent version of tox to 2.8.0 (#178) and further to 2.8.1 (#180)
 * Updated all tests such that our coverage aim of 96%+ is maintained.

1.10.3 (28AUG17)
----------------
 * Corrected the creation of partmodels (`Part` with category `MODEL`) with multiplicities other than `ZERO_MANY` as the provided multiplicity option was not respected in the `create_model()` method of `Client` and `Scope`. Thanks @raduiordache for the find. (#170)
 * Updated tests.

1.10.2 (22AUG17)
----------------
 * Corrected the ability to assign multiple assignees, using a list of assignees to an activity using the `Activity.edit()` method. (#167)
 * Updated tests.

1.10.1 (18AUG17)
----------------
 * updated incorrect tests related to `Activity.associated_parts()`. (#96, #149)

1.10.0 (18AUG17)
----------------
 * Ability to edit the status of an `Activity`. Please refer to the `ActivityStatus` enumerations. (#163)
 * Ability to sort properties of a `Part` model. (#141)
 * Upgraded the requirements of dependent packages for development. (#152, #160, #159, #153, #157, #154)
 * Added tests for all new features to get the > 95% coverage
 * Updated the documentation.

1.9.1 (27JUN17)
---------------
 * Improved testing. Notably on the new inspector objects. No functional change only that we want to reach our goal of 95% test coverage! Thanks to @raduiordache (#137)

1.9.0 (23JUN17)
---------------

 * Added a major new feature to create `Customization`s of activities in KE-chain 2 all programmatically and pythonic. We provide building block classes such as `SuperGrid`, `PaginatedGrid`s and `PropertyGrid`s to make your own task customization. All is documented with examples. A `validation()` method is available. (#110)

    >>> my_task = project.activity('my task')
    >>> bike = project.part(name='Bike')
    >>> customization = Customization()  # init customization object for the task
    >>> my_prop_grid = PropertyGrid(part=bike, title=bike.name)  # create a PropertyGrid
    >>> customization.add_component(my_prop_grid)  # add PropertyGrid to the Customization component list
    >>> customization.validate()  # you can validate the customization
    >>> my_task.customize(customization)  # upload/set the Customization. Ensure you have data access set correctly.

 * Updated the way the `Activity.customize()` method works. This method now accepts a `Customization` object or a josn (as a python dict). It uses the `Customization.validate()` method to validate if it conforms to the required json structure before uploading it to KE-chain.
 * Improved test coverage and refactored the HTTP codes to human readable form. (#128)
 * Added the ability to edit the description of property models. This was included in `Part.create_property(... description=...)` (#135)
 * Add `Part.as_dict()` method to retrieve the properties of a part in pykechain as a python dictionary as `{<property_name> : <property_value>}` (#131)
 * Added the ability to optionally update the name of a part together with the value of its properties. See the `Part.update()` method. (#126)
 * Deprecated the `Activity.create_activity()` method in favor of `Activity.create()`. Use the latter. Will warn with a `DeprecationWarning` until removed.


1.8.0 (05JUN17)
---------------
 * Added `Part.instances()` method for models to find their associated instances. (#113) Also added a
   `Part.instance()` method if you for sure that you will get only a single instance back.
 * Added `Activity.subprocess()`, `Activity.siblings()` and `Activity.children()` methods to the `Activity`.
   It eases relative retrieval of other tasks in the task tree. Documentation is included. (#100)
 * added `Activity.activity_type` property to the Activity.
 * added `ActivityType` enumeration. This can be used to check if the `activity_type` of an `Activity` is either
   a Usertask or a Subprocess.
 * Added ability to retrieve an `Activity` based on an id. As this included in the low level `Client` object,
   it can be used almost everywhere to retrieve an activity by its id (or primary key, pk) eg. in the `Scope.activity`.
 * Added ability to add additional keywords to the activities searcher to be able to search by name, pk, container etc.
 * Added a FutureDeprecationWarning to the `Activity.create_activity()` method. This will is replace with the
   `Activity.create()` method. Update your code please!
 * Added a convenience method to retrieve models and instances related to a task at once:
   `Activity.associated_parts()`. Making use of the already provided method in `Activity.parts()`. (#118)
 * Added missing tests for `Activity.parts()` and `Activity.associated_parts()`
 * added tests for all new features.
 * Updated the documentation.


1.7.3 (01JUN17)
---------------
 * Updated documentation for activity startdate and duedate editting using timezone supported datetime objects.
   If a user want to make use of timezone aware datetime the best way to do it is::

    >>> my_tz = pytz.timezone('Europe/Amsterdam')
    >>> start_date = my_tz.localize(datetime(2017,6,1,23,59,0))
    >>> due_date = my_tz.localize(datetime(2017,12,31))
    >>> my_task.edit(start_date = start_date, due_date = due_date)

 * Fixed a bug where a naive due_date and no provided start_date resulted in an error. Keep them bugs comin'!


1.7.2 (01JUN17)
---------------
 * updated `property.part` property that gets the part for its property. For model this did not work as underlying
   only `category=INSTANCES` were retrieved. Thanks to @joost.schut for finding it and reporting.
 * updated requirements for development.


1.7.1 (29MAY17)
---------------
 * Added `Part.multiplicity` property method. Use the `pykechain.enums.Multiplicity` to check the multiplicity of a part
   against the set multiplicities.
 * Updated documentation (a.o. the Basic Usage notebook).


1.7.0 (29MAY17)
---------------
 * Added `ReferencyProperty.choices()` convenience method to provide you the list of parts (instances) that are
   acceptable as a choice for the value of the reference property.
 * Added `Part.proxy_model()` method that will return the model that is used as the basis for the proxied model.
   A proxied model is a linkedcopy of the proxy_model that can have a different name, but follow that exact model
   definition of the proxy_model including its properties and submodel parts. A handy way to create model structures
   in the catalog world and use a multiple of those in the product world. An example is provided in the documentation.
 * Added the `Activity.edit()` method to be able to update the activity name, description, start_date, due_date
   and assignee.
 * Added the ability to customize an activity using the `Activity.customize()` method using a proper inspector NG json.
 * Upgraded package `requests` to the latest version.
 * Updated documentation according to PEP257.
 * Updated requirements for development.


1.6.0 (3MAY17)
--------------
 * Added a `Part.model()` method to retrieve the model from an instance.
 * (Backwards Incompatibile) The task configuration (association) API is updated to the
   latest KE-chain release (release 2.1.0b-sprint119 30MAR17). This affects the `activity.configure()` method.
   This change is not compatible with older KE-chain 2 releases. For older KE-chain 2 releases use a
   pykechain version < 1.6
 * Added `Getting Started`_ documentation page for pykechain using jupyter notebooks
 * Documentation update for the reference property
 * Updated documentation according to PEP257

.. _Getting Started: http://pykechain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/00_getting_started.html

1.5.1 (6APR17)
--------------
 * Patch release to include the python package typing.

1.5.0 (6APR17)
--------------

 * Added ability to edit the part name and description functionality. See the `Part.edit()` method.
 * Added the ability to use the bulk_update_properties API endpoint for KE-chain releases later then 2.1.0b. No need to
   alter your pykechain code. The implementation of `Part.update()` method is augmented to use this faster method of
   uploading changes to property values. For connections to legacy KE-chain 2 instances, use the switch `bulk=False`.
 * Added the ability to create a new part and provide its properties values for KE-chain releases later then 2.1.0b.
   You can use the new `Part.add_with_properties()` method and it will connect to the new KE-chain API endpoint of
   'new_instance_with_properties'. Properties are provided by name and value in a dict. For examples see the docs.
 * Reference properties can now be set with a Part directly. Setting a reference property to None will clear the value.
 * Added the ability to create a proxy model with `Part.add_proxy_to()` and `Client.create_proxy_model()`. For exmaples
   see the documentation.
 * Added enumerations for `Category` and `Multiplicity` in `pykechain.enums`. You can use these constants to ensure
   that these values are correct, aligned and thusfor accepted by KE-chain. Examples are included in the documentation.
 * Attachment properties have now a value set if there is a file attached in KE-chain. Otherwise the value is None.
   Now you are able to check if there is a file attachment set before you download or upload. See the docs for examples.
 * Added type annotations throughout the code and added mypy to the continuous integration pipeline to ensure high
   quality of the code provided.
 * Improved the documentation



1.4.0 (17FEB17)
---------------
 * Added functionality to create part models, just as you create part instances.
 * Added functionality to upload files (using filename), python objects (as json) and matplotlib figures as attachments
 * Added functionality to download attachments directly as file or python objects (from json).
 * Improved logic if you request children or siblings that the corresponding category (Model or Instance) is retrieved.
 * Improved continuous integration.
 * Improved documentation

1.3.0 (16FEB17)
---------------

 * Added functionality to support a select list property type from KE-chain in pykechain. Now you can inquire for the
   options and set the list of options (on the model) to choose from. See documentation of `SelectListProperty`_.
 * Added additional keyword arguments to the `Client.parts()` method. This allows access to additional filters on the
   KE-chain REST API.
 * Fixed a bug that shows a warning when importing pykechain without a `.env` file being present. Improved documentation
   of the `Client.from_env()`_ method. Including an example of this .env file.
 * Improved documentation
 * Improved testing (and coverage)
 * Improved introspection of `PartSet`.

.. _Client.from_env(): http://pykechain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/client.html#pykechain.Client.from_env

1.2.0 (14FEB17)
---------------

 * batch updates of properties in a part using a dictionary is now possible using the part `update({'prop_name': val})`
   `Part`_ method.
 * added relational methods on the part like: `Part.parent()`, `Part.children()` and `Part.siblings()`. See
   documentation of `Part`_ for that.
 * improved documentation
 * improved testing
 * improved introspection of objects due to correct representation for debugging
 * version number now available through pykechain.version

.. _Part: http://pykechain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/models.html#pykechain.models.Part

1.1.2 (7FEB17)
--------------

 * improved (iterative) part retriever capability with a batch processed request. Will enable to retrieve large datasets
   than normal, that take longer than a standard timeout. Will concatenate the results of the various requests.
   Check out the documentation for the new `limit` and `batch` parameters on the `Client.parts`_ method.
 * improved upload of files and attachments
 * added bucket and limit filters to limit the number of parts retrieved
 * improved testing
 * improved coverage
 * updated dependencies
 * improved documentation

1.0.0 (3JAN17)
--------------

 * First public release of pykechain
 * ability to create a client to connect to a KE-chain instance
 * ability to retrieve parts and properties within a KE-chain scope (project)
 * ability to retrieve activities with a KE-chain scope
 * ability to upload and download a property value

0.1.0.dev0 - 0.1.1.dev0 (23DEC16)
---------------------------------

 * Initial pre-release of pykechain
 * ability to create a client to connect to a KE-chain instance
 * ability to retrieve parts and properties within a KE-chain scope (project)
 * limited ability to upload and download a property value
